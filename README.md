# Hey there, I'm Aniket Kolte! 👋  
### 💻 Java Backend Developer | Spring Boot Enthusiast | 3rd Year B.E. Student | Budding Engineer

### 🧠 About Me  
I’m a dedicated **B.E. student in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science** at **P.V.G.'s College of Engineering, Pune**, with a strong passion for **Java backend development** using **Spring Boot**. I love building reliable, scalable APIs and backend services that solve real-world problems.

While my primary focus is backend development, I also believe **great developers test what they build** — that’s why I’m confident in writing clean, tested, and production-ready code.

### 💼 What I Do
- 🛠️ **Build RESTful APIs** using Spring Boot & Java  
- 🔐 **Implement authentication & role-based access** using Spring Security + JWT  
- 🧪 **Write unit & integration tests** with JUnit and TestNG  
- 🔄 **Use tools like Postman, JMeter, and Selenium** to automate and validate backend systems  
- 🧰 Apply solid software practices: clean code, exception handling, and layered architecture  
- 📊 Currently exploring microservices, databases, and DevOps tools
